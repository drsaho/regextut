Understanding Regex for Matching a Hexadecimal Color Value

## Summary

A hexadecimal color value is commonly used in web development to specify colors in CSS. This regex allows you to validate if a string is a valid hex color, which is typically represented in the form of #RRGGBB or #RGB. This tutorial will break down each part of the regex to explain how it works.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
`^`: The caret symbol at the beginning of the regex ensures that the match starts at the beginning of the string.
$: The dollar sign at the end of the regex ensures that the match ends at the end of the string.
These anchors ensure that the entire string is evaluated, not just a part of it.


### Quantifiers

`{6}`: This quantifier matches exactly six occurrences of [a-f0-9], representing the full 6-digit hex color (e.g., #FFFFFF).
{3}: This quantifier matches exactly three occurrences of [a-f0-9], representing the shorthand 3-digit hex color (e.g., #FFF).

### OR Operator
`|`: The pipe symbol | is known as the OR operator in regular expressions. It allows you to match one pattern or another.

In the regex ([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3}), the OR operator is used between two groups:
`[a-f0-9]{6}: This matches exactly six characters from the set [a-f0-9].
[a-f0-9]{3}: This matches exactly three characters from the set [a-f0-9].
This means that the regex will match a string that either has six hexadecimal characters or three hexadecimal characters, but not both at the same time. For example, it matches both #FF5733 (6 digits) and #F53 (3 digits).

### Character Classes

`[a-f0-9]`: This is a character class. In regular expressions, a character class allows you to match any one character from a specific set of characters.
a-f: This range specifies any lowercase letter from a to f. In hexadecimal notation, these letters represent the numbers 10 to 15.
0-9: This range specifies any digit from 0 to 9.
Together, [a-f0-9] matches any single character that is either a digit (0-9) or a lowercase letter between a and f. This is essential for matching hexadecimal digits, which are the building blocks of hex color codes.

### Flags
Flags in regular expressions modify how the pattern is interpreted. They are placed after the closing delimiter of the regular expression, outside the slashes. In the context of the regex we are working with (`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`), no flags are used

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit in a regex, while capturing stores the matched content for later use.

Syntax: ()

Example: In the regex /(abc)/, abc is grouped together. This means the regex will look for the exact sequence abc.

Capturing: The content matched by the group is stored, and you can reference it later in the same regex or access it programmatically. For example, /(abc)\1/ would match abcabc because \1 refers to the content captured by the first group.

Non-capturing Groups: If you don't want to capture the group, you can use (?:...). For example, (?:abc) groups abc without capturing it.


### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, match any one of the characters within the brackets.

Syntax: []
Example: [a-z] matches any lowercase letter from a to z.
Ranges: You can specify a range of characters, like [0-9] for digits or [A-Fa-f] for hexadecimal characters.
Negation: Placing a caret ^ at the beginning negates the class, so [^a-z] matches any character that is not a lowercase letter.
